# SIT323-2025-prac2p

This is the public repo used for my submissions to the SIT323 unit for Deakin University.

## To install the dependancies

- Run "npm install" from the root directory. This will install:
  - Nodemon.js
  - Express.js
- Run "npm start" from project root to start the server. The server will be restarted upon server change saves for production
- Access <http://localhost:3000> inside your browser to request resources from the server (currently static-HTML)
